# 1D-Hydro-Solver
This code was written for HW5 as a part of an graduate level astrophysical gas dynamics course. This code solves the HD equations using a finite volume dsicretization and a leap frog scheme. Symmetry boundary conditions are used. This code is not perfect as there were complications with implementing the CFL condition properly
